# The sponsor Myanmar refugees project

This is a website showing refugee kids from Northern Myanmar in need of Sponsors. There are around 70 kids featured on the page, the kids are victims of the civil war going on in Northern Myanmar right now.

The site consists of a simple home page showing all the kids photos, names, ages, and their current status: sponsored or unsponsored.

There will also be an about page with more info on who I am and my connection to the children's home in Myanmar.
